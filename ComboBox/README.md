# 📚 ComboBox Exercise - C# Windows Forms
A simple **C# Windows Forms** exercise demonstrating how to use a **ComboBox** to change a displayed picture based on the selected item — for example: **Book, Pen, Boy, Girl**.

## ✅ Features
- Uses a ComboBox to display selectable items.
- Automatically updates an image (or label text) based on the selected item.
- Simple and clean UI for beginners.
- Demonstrates handling the `SelectedIndexChanged` event.

## 🧠 How It Works
The ComboBox includes the following items: `Book`, `Pen`, `Boy`, `Girl`.
When the user selects an item, the image in the PictureBox changes accordingly.

## 🖥 Example Behavior
- Selecting **Book** → shows a book image.
- Selecting **Pen** → shows a pen image.
- Selecting **Boy** → shows a boy image.
- Selecting **Girl** → shows a girl image.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the project in **Visual Studio**.
2. Add the images (book, pen, boy, girl) to `Properties → Resources`.
3. Run the app using **Start (F5)**.
4. Select any item from the ComboBox and observe the change.

## 📦 Requirements
- Visual Studio 2019 or later.
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher.
- Images added to the project’s resources.
