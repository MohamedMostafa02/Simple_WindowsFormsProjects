# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe - C# Windows Forms Application

A simple and fun **Tic Tac Toe (X-O)** game built using **C# Windows Forms**. This project demonstrates event handling, UI interaction, and game logic implementation in a desktop environment.

---

## ✅ Features
- Playable **2-player mode** on the same computer.  
- Interactive **Windows Forms UI** with buttons for each cell.  
- Automatic detection of **win**, **draw**, and **reset** states.  
- **Score tracking** (optional enhancement).  
- Clean, commented, and beginner-friendly C# code.

---

## 🧠 How It Works
- The game board consists of **9 buttons (3x3 grid)**.  
- Each button click triggers an event that:
  - Places the current player's mark (`X` or `O`).  
  - Disables the clicked button.  
  - Checks for winning or draw conditions.  
- A message box displays the result (“X Wins!”, “O Wins!”, or “Draw!”).  
- A **Reset** button allows restarting the game without closing the app.

X | O | X

Result: X Wins!
```
